# Source files

The files in the `c` directory originate from the `last1120c.tar.gz` archive
located at <https://minnie.tuhs.org/TUHS/Archive/Applications/Early_C_Compilers/>
They constitute a working C compiler for UNIX 2nd Edition.

The files in the `lib` directory are derived from the `libc.sa` file contained
in the `last1120c.tar.gz` tape image, also available at the same URL. They
constitute the C library for the compiler mentioned above.

The files in the `cmd` directory have been reconstructed from text fragments
found in the `s1-bits.gz` file, accessible at <https://minnie.tuhs.org/TUHS/Archive/Distributions/Research/1972_stuff/>.
Doug Merritt and Warren Toomey undertook the reconstruction, creating the source
code for some of the commands in UNIX 2nd Edition.
